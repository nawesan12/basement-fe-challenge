# How did i make this?

## Stack:
- NextJS
- GSAP
- Tailwind
- Shadcn-ui
- Zustand
- Sonner

## Process

With the Figma file it was quite easy to mockup the whole structure of the web, first i created all the components boilerplate to build the main scaffolding and then i started to implement the styles and features to each of them.
I coded manually the main texts of the header and the footer, but then i discovered that they were images at the Figma file hahaha.

![Basement Supply Main View Mobile](main-view-mobile.png "Basement Supply Main View Mobile")

| Image 1 | Image 2 |
|---|---|
| <img src="main-view-desktop.png" alt="Image 1"> | <img src="main-view-mobile.png" alt="Image 2"> |

Once i had all the styles well achieved, i started with the animations, the levitating shapes and the cart sheet were my favourites parts because of the GSAP's versatility and possibilities that provides
