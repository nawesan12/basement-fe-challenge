# How did i make this?

## Stack:
- NextJS
- GSAP
- Tailwind
- Shadcn-ui
- Zustand
- Sonner

## Process

With the Figma file it was quite easy to mockup the whole structure of the web, first i created all the components boilerplate to build the main scaffolding and then i started to implement the styles and features to each of them.
I coded manually the main texts of the header and the footer, but then i discovered that they were images at the Figma file hahaha.


| Basement Supply Main View Desktop | Basement Supply Main View Mobile |
|---|---|
| <img src="main-view-desktop.png" alt="Basement Supply Main View Desktop"> | <img src="main-view-mobile.png" alt="Basement Supply Main View Mobile"> |

Once i had all the styles well achieved, i started with the animations, the levitating shapes and the cart sheet were my favourites parts because of the GSAP's versatility and possibilities that provides.

<img src="cart-view-mobile.png" alt="Basement Supply Main View Mobile" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
The cart was pretty cool to build because i could use Shadcn to build the right animation in the most efficient way. And i used Zustand to manage the products, their quantity, and some variables views of the cart itself

## Conclusion
The correct implementation of Zustand and Shadcn allowed to build the whole project in just a few hours, keeping in mind that maybe there were many things that were achieved, polish was not compromised.
